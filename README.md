Updating REDME file to test

14th Feb 2019
Hey Stephanie, I updated the code and now the ouput is blank. I'm debugging it and the W values are being calculated but i need toadjust for adelay with reading from the RAM. I still don't know why the digest still shows up blank but it might have to do with the flag I have in my part not being set properly. I uploaded the code with the test variables in the hub tho. I uploaded the simultions I did so far so you can see. I havent checked your part.
